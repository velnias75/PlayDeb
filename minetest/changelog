minetest (0.4.12+repack-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Imported Upstream version 0.4.12+repack. (Closes: #778853)
  * Drop the following patches. They were merged upstream.
    - desktop-file.patch
    - hurd.patch
    - hyphen-used-as-minus.patch
  * Drop desktop-file-fix-icon.patch. Instead rename minetest icons and use
    the upstream name again. Install minetest.xpm to /usr/share/pixmaps which
    is a better location for xpm files.
  * Use dh_installchangelogs override for installing the upstream changelog.
  * Drop useless-depends.patch. Add missing build-dependencies instead.
  * Add libbz2-dev, libglu1-mesa-dev, libpng-dev and libjpeg-dev to
    Build-Depends.
  * wrap-and-sort -sa.
  * Drop gcc47.patch because it is obsolete.
  * Create directory for minetest.xpm in debian/rules and improve formatting.
  * Remove dh_auto_build override. Use --parallel with main dh invocation.
  * Use dh_auto_configure command to pass on build flags. Do not call cmake
    manually.
  * Rename debianization.patch to FindIrrlicht.cmake.patch. Append
    libIrrlicht.so to search patch instead of replacing other alternatives.
  * Drop dynamic-link.patch. Add FindJson.cmake.patch instead.
    - Remove unnecessary hunks and patch only FindJson.cmake module. This
      ensures that Debian's system json library will be used and simplifies
      future updates.

  * Update DEP3 patch headers and remove jthread-changed.patch because
    it was not applied anyway.
  * Update useless-depends.patch.
    Readd X11 library otherwise the build will fail due to missing symbols.
  * minetest-server.service: Restart server unit on-failure.
  * Export DEB_LDFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND = -Wl,--as-needed to avoid useless
    dependencies.
  * Add desktop-file.patch and hyphen-used-as-minus.patch.
    Add keywords to desktop file and fix lintian warning hyphen-used-as-minus
    sign.
  * debian/upstream.changelog: Just point to upstream's wiki for retrieving the
    latest changelog.
  * Update debian/copyright for new release and use a more permissible license
    for debian/patches/.
  * debian/rules: Enable verbose Makefile to detect possible compilation
    issues.
